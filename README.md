# python-projects-journey
This repository contains my Python learning journey through hands-on projects.

I started learning C and Python on September 13, 2025.  
Here, I collect the projects I build while improving my programming skills.

## What I am learning
- Python basics
- Problem solving
- Working with files and data
- Writing clean and readable code
- Working with PyQt5 and SQL
- Git and GitHub basics

## 📂 Projects
Each folder in this repository represents a separate project.  
Every project includes source code and a short explanation.

Projects will be added step by step as I continue learning.

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to become a strong developer by practicing through real projects and continuously improving my skills.  
After graduating from school, I plan to apply to the top 3 IT universities.
